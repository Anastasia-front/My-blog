      <h1 class="title">My way to the programming</h1>
      <p>
        My journey began in the summer of 2022 - then I first got acquainted
        with programming. My husband led me to this interesting decision -
        before getting a job as a support engineer, he studied a lot in courses
        and on his own, and also made a project to search for films on Angular
        (like an online guide).  </p>
        <p>
For understanding, my husband and I started with
        Python to understand the basic concepts - and then we moved on to
        studying Java script. Naturally, we figured out the layout in a proper
        way. In August, we purchased a Python course from Alexey Nemchinsky, but
        it turned out to be useless (because we had previously studied a lot of
        freely available materials that explained all topics in more detail and
        concisely). Until the end of October, I gradually figured it out on my
        own (during this time I completed 4 projects, but they did not meet the
        standards), but I understood that the more complex the material, the
        less high-quality and relevant free resources are available on the
        Internet. Therefore, we approached the issue of acquiring effective
        courses more carefully - and on November 28 I was enrolled for training
        in the 78th stream of IT GO.
        </p>  
      <p>On the first team project on soft skills in
        group 15, I was approved for the position of Scrum Master for active and
        proactive participation in the work - under my leadership, we got a
        beautiful and original project. Already on December 20, I defended all
        the works and applied for the transition to the previous stream in order
        to speed up the learning process. On December 24, I was already enrolled
        in stream 74 and on January 9, 2023, we started a team project on
        technical skills. </p> 
      </p>Since there was a mentor in the courses, he helped to
        structure the code and therefore I made the next 2 projects on the first
        module (layout) much faster and better. Now I`m just starting the second
        block in Java script - but knowing the basic concepts, I hope to finish
        this module faster so that I can master all the course material not in
        10 months (under the contract) - in 7 already for sure (2 months ahead
        of my flow). </p>
